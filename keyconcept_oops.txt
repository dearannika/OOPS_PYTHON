Class: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure).
Object: An instance of a class.
Attributes: Properties of an object, usually variables.
Methods: Functions associated with an object that can manipulate its attributes.
Encapsulation: Hiding the internal state of the object and requiring all interaction to be performed through methods.
Inheritance: Mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
Polymorphism: Ability to process objects differently based on their class or data type.
Abstraction: Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem
